        <p>
          The sports car bonus is a community reward for Aptos Trip NFT holders, not a lottery or gambling prize. The following terms apply:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>7.1 Eligibility:</strong> All holders of Aptos Trip NFTs as of June 1, 2026, are eligible, provided all 5,000 NFTs are minted.</li>
          <li><strong>7.2 Selection Process:</strong> One recipient will be chosen on June 1, 2026, using the Aptos Randomness API, a transparent and verifiable randomization method. Chances are based on NFT rarity and collected sets, with a maximum wallet cap of 3% (see FAQ for details).</li>
          <li><strong>7.3 Reward:</strong> The selected holder will receive a sports car, as determined by the project, with its value based on mobile.de market pricing at the time of selection.</li>
          <li><strong>7.4 Expenses:</strong> All costs related to the car's registration, taxes, duties, and transportation are the sole responsibility of the selected holder.</li>
          <li><strong>7.5 Refusal Option:</strong> If the selected holder declines the sports car (e.g., due to logistical, legal, or personal reasons), they will receive 80% of the car's market value in APT, based on mobile.de pricing at the time of selection.</li>
          <li><strong>7.6 Taxes and Fees:</strong> The recipient is solely responsible for any taxes, duties, or fees associated with receiving the sports car or APT payment. Aptos Trip will not cover these costs.</li>
          <li><strong>7.7 Non-Guaranteed:</strong> Holding an NFT does not guarantee receiving the sports car or APT payment, as only one holder will be selected.</li>
          <li><strong>7.8 Legal Compliance:</strong> The sports car bonus complies with applicable laws and is not classified as a lottery or gambling activity. The project reserves the right to adjust the reward process to ensure legal compliance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>8. Royalties and Resale</h3>
        <p>
